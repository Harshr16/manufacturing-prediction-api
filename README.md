# Manufacturing Downtime Prediction API

This project implements a RESTful API using Flask to predict machine downtime based on temperature and runtime values. The API allows users to upload a manufacturing dataset, train a logistic regression model, and make predictions on new data.

**Requirements**

   Python 3.x
   pip (Python package manager)

**Setup Instructions**

1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.
2. Run the Flask application: python app.py

**API Endpoints**

1. Upload Data (POST /upload)<br/>
      Uploads a CSV file containing the manufacturing data. The CSV file contains following columns:<br/>

     i. Machine_ID<br/>
     ii. Temperature<br/>
     iii. Run_Time<br/>
     iv. Downtime_Flag<br/><br/>
      
     Example Request:<br/>
     **curl -X POST -F "file=@synthetic_manufacturing_data.csv" http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload**
2. Train Model (POST /train)<br/>
     Trains a logistic regression model using the uploaded dataset. The model uses Temperature and Run_Time as features and predicts        Downtime_Flag.

     Example Request:<br/>
       **curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/train**
3. Make Prediction (POST /predict)<br/>
     Make predictions on new data (Temperature and Run_Time). Returns whether the machine is likely to experience downtime (Yes or No)      and the confidence level of the prediction.

     Example Request:<br/>
       **curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"Temperature": 110, "Run_Time": 250}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict**

**Sample Dataset**

  A synthetic dataset is generated by the generate_synthetic_data function and saved as synthetic_manufacturing_data.csv. You can use    this dataset to test the API.

**Testing the API**

  Once the Flask application is running, you can test the endpoints using Postman or curl.

**Conclusion**

  This API provides a simple interface for predicting machine downtime based on temperature and run-time data. It uses a logistic        regression model and allows for uploading datasets, training the model, and making predictions on new data.
